# Intro

This is a repository for tracking progress throughout this training module!

## This comes from Visual Studio

Following the tutorial..

## Notes:

When files are created, they will be untracked by git. 

To view the status of newly created files, use "git status".

To allow tracking, use the command "git add <filename>".

Additionally, you can use "git add ." to track all untracked files in your directory.

### Commits:

*A commit acts like a save, but only to your local machine*

To commit a change, use "git commit -m "name/header".

"-m" is the flag to add a message, a commit must have a message.

You could use two "-m" flags, the first one will be the commit name/header and the second will be more of a description.

ex: git commit -m "Added index.html" -m "Hello world!"

### Push:

*A push updates the remote repository, in this case, on github.*

To push a commit and make it live on the remote repository, use "git push origin master".
